/// system Back gesture has to leave *those* first instead of tearing the route
/// down. This scope owns exactly one route pop:
///
/// - while a presentation is active, Back leaves it and keeps the page;
/// - otherwise [onBackRequest] is asked, and only an unhandled request pops.
///
/// It exists in Core rather than beside one player because the interception it
/// depends on is not a Flutter-level affair: Android 13+ delivers Back to the
/// Activity, Flutter registers its own callback there at DEFAULT priority, and
/// the route is popped before any `PopScope` runs unless the host has registered
/// a PRIORITY_OVERLAY callback through [AndroidPredictiveBackService]. A player
/// page that only wraps itself in `PopScope` therefore looks correct and never
/// receives the event — which is why both the live room and the recording player
/// mount this scope instead.
///

/// before this callback is considered.
