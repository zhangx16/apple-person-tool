/// The gesture layer, the progress bar and the "leave the picture" half of the
/// control bar are the same on every surface this app plays video on: a live
/// room and a recorded file differ in *where the media comes from*, not in how a
/// viewer scrubs, changes volume, or leaves the picture. Those widgets live in
/// Core, which may not know about a room, a recording or a quality list — so they
/// talk to this instead, and each player supplies its own implementation.
///
/// Deliberately small: everything a shared control can drive, and nothing about
/// rooms, files, platform sites or EPG. A member belongs here only when at least
/// two players need it.
///
/// Responsibilities:
///
/// - expose play state, position and the transport actions
/// - expose the surface gestures' two targets: brightness and volume
/// - expose the danmaku surface a player is rendering
///

///
/// - own playback (the kernel handle does)
/// - know which source is playing
/// - carry room, file or quality state
