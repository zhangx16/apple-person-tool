# Android device UI map

`device_ui_map.json` is the durable, screenshot-free UI test map for PureLive.
`android_ui.ps1` selects a profile by the device's current resolution and
orientation, scales cached coordinates when appropriate, and drives ADB taps,
swipes and common multi-step flows.

## Recorded baseline

The primary device is now the K90 Pro (`25102RKBEC`, codename `myron`) running
Android 17. Its network-ADB profiles are:

- portrait `1200 x 2608`;
- landscape `2608 x 1200`.

The first K90 Pro coordinates are proportionally migrated from the retained
PJZ110 measurements. Before the first state-changing use of any point, run
`-Validate` and prefer `-VerifySemantics`; record a fresh screen snapshot after
the corresponding route is physically verified. This avoids treating scaled
coordinates as measured evidence.

The repository also retains the measured OnePlus 13 / PJZ110 profiles as an
archived regression baseline for:

- portrait `1440 x 3168`: home, live/offline filters, visible platform tabs,
  room cards, drawer, the full settings list, live-room app bar, player controls,
  danmaku tabs, local danmaku send, bottom navigation and scrolling gestures;
- landscape `3168 x 1440`: live-room app bar, video area, audio/cast/PiP controls,
  quality/line controls and the complete right-side danmaku panel;
- stable screen catalogs for home, drawer, settings top/middle/bottom and the
  live-room base state.

Dynamic room titles and danmaku text are not treated as stable controls.

## Fast path and verification

Before any state-changing device command, acquire the Pure Live turn through
`tool/run_android_device_test_turn.ps1`. The phone is shared with the BiliRoaming and
Xiaohongshu tasks in the fixed `biliroaming -> xhs -> purelive` rotation; see
`docs/ANDROID_DEVICE_TEST_ROTATION.md`. The foreground-package guard below is
still mandatory after the lease is acquired.

Normal runs use the cached coordinates directly, so they do not take a
screenshot and do not run image recognition. The script brings PureLive to the
foreground and verifies `topResumedActivity` before every action. This prevents
a cached coordinate from being sent to another app if the user changes apps
during a test.

`-VerifySemantics` optionally resolves a stored accessibility label with
UIAutomator before tapping. This is slower, but remains screenshot-free and is
useful after a layout change. If the label is unavailable, the measured
coordinate remains the fallback.

Route-sensitive sequences may use bilingual `tapSemantic` candidates followed
by `assertSemantic`. The assertion reads the destination accessibility tree and
ends the sequence with an error when the expected page-only label is absent, so
a stale coordinate or unchanged screen is never reported as a successful route.

Screenshots and UI XML are collected only when a command fails and
`-CaptureOnFailure` was explicitly supplied.

Always pass the exact IP serial when the same wireless device is also exposed
through an mDNS alias. Pairing ports and codes are ephemeral and must not be
stored in this repository. Root access is not required by the UI regression
workflow and is never inferred from device-side manager applications.

## Commands

```powershell
# Validate JSON references and list every known point/flow/snapshot
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Validate
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -List

# Preview or execute a cached action flow
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Sequence toggle_audio -DryRun
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Sequence toggle_audio

# Open frequently tested settings pages from the home page
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Sequence open_pip_danmaku_settings
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Sequence open_local_interaction_settings
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Sequence open_general_settings

# In an acquired device turn, verify PiP preview enable/disable and persistence.
# The runner restores the exact canonical Hive file and stops the app afterward.
.\tool\android_pip_danmaku_settings_smoke.ps1 `
  -Serial '192.168.1.2:5555' `
  -EvidenceDirectory 'local-artifacts/diagnostics/pip-danmaku-settings'

# Resolve one visible control from accessibility semantics, without a screenshot
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -TapSemantic '关闭菜单'

# Recheck a cached control against the current semantic tree before tapping
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Tap live.audio_toggle -VerifySemantics

# Record/correct a coordinate once; future tests reuse it
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Record settings.example -X 1200 -Y 900 `
  -Label '设置：示例入口'

# Store all stable actionable controls on the current route
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Snapshot settings.example
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -RemoveSnapshot settings.example

# Save screenshot/XML evidence only if the requested action fails
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Sequence toggle_audio -CaptureOnFailure
```

Controls that auto-hide use a cached two-step flow: tap
`live.show_controls`, wait 700 ms, then tap the target. A UI hierarchy dump is
deliberately skipped on this fast path because it can outlive the control layer.

## Maintenance rules

1. Keep separate profiles for portrait and landscape; never rotate portrait
   coordinates blindly.
2. Add a semantic label whenever Flutter exposes one, but retain a measured
   coordinate for fast execution.
3. Give scroll-dependent points a suffix such as `_after_scroll2` and encode
   the required swipes in a named sequence.
4. Refresh the affected screen snapshot after a layout change and run
   `-Validate` before device regression.
5. Verify player state through app logs/semantics after each action. A successful
   tap alone is not a playback result.
6. End navigation sequences with a destination-only `assertSemantic` whenever a
   stable label exists; include both Chinese and English aliases for localized
   routes.

## v3.0.22 竖屏全屏手势

在已经验证坐标的设备上进入稳定识别的竖屏直播间后，可直接复用：

```powershell
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Sequence enter_portrait_fullscreen
.\tool\android_ui.ps1 -Sequence restore_portrait_panel
```

两个流程分别从竖屏弹幕面板手柄下滑进入沉浸展示、从屏幕底部上滑恢复弹幕栏。它们只记录确定坐标与等待时间；直播源是否为稳定竖屏仍由应用自身状态机判定，脚本不会强制普通直播进入该模式。
